Core part of shell is command line interpreter CLI
two functons
1.reads and parses the commands entered  //executes in front end
2.executes these parced command  //executes at back ebd

parsing: dividing input into tokens
token contains one or more characters
each tken is a single unit of input

these tokens are stored in ast(sbstract syntax tree)
executer picks from it and executes that command

when shell is running it is in repl loop
read eval print loop (user interactive mode)

symbol table:
a structure storing variables. Evironment variables or global 
variables its values and attributes

built in utility: special commands that are basic components of 
shell

lifeline of a shell: 
initialization:when we start shell some config files are loaded
interpretation: repl loop
termination: closing shell
